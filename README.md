# Ping CRM [Work In Progress !]

A demo application to illustrate how Inertia.js works with:

- Server-side adapter: [masonite-inertia](https://github.com/girardinsamuel/masonite-inertia.git) for [MasoniteFramework](https://github.com/MasoniteFramework/masonite)
- Client-side adapter: [inertia.js]() for [Vue.js](https://github.com/vuejs/vue)

Disclaimer :

- the demo is based on the [official Inertia.js demo](https://github.com/inertiajs/pingcrm.git) (for the Vue part)
- there are still bugs because it's a WIP

This demo is using [masonite-js-routes](https://github.com/girardinsamuel/masonite-js-routes) to publish routes client-side and `ziggy-js` which provides a very handy `route()` helper in Javascript !
